## Completed Tasks âœ…
1. Project Structure Setup
   - [x] Created basic directory structure
   - [x] Set up virtual environment
   - [x] Installed core dependencies
   - [x] Initialized git repository

2. Core Development
   - [x] Implemented SQLite database setup
   - [x] Created database models
   - [x] Implemented PDF handling
   - [x] Created API endpoints
   - [x] Added basic error handling

3. Documentation
   - [x] Created implementation plan
   - [x] Added project structure documentation
   - [x] Created testing documentation
   - [x] Added bug tracking system

4. Deployment Configuration
   - [x] Created render.yaml
   - [x] Set up environment variables
   - [x] Configured for production

## Current Status
- Basic functionality is working
- All core endpoints tested and verified
- Deployment configuration ready
- Documentation up to date

## Next Steps
1. Deployment
   - [ ] Deploy to Render
   - [ ] Test production environment
   - [ ] Set up monitoring

2. Enhancements
   - [ ] Add PDF content extraction
   - [ ] Implement resume formatting
   - [ ] Add user authentication
   - [ ] Set up automated testing

3. Maintenance
   - [ ] Monitor application performance
   - [ ] Implement backup strategy
   - [ ] Plan for scalability

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)
1. Create project structure
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install core dependencies:
   - FastAPI
   - SQLAlchemy
   - python-multipart
   - reportlab (for PDF generation)
   - python-dotenv

## Core Implementation (30 minutes)
1. Create FastAPI app with SQLite database
2. Implement three main endpoints:
   ```python
   # POST /resume/upload - Upload and process resume
   # GET /resume/{id} - Get resume data
   # GET /resume/{id}/pdf - Get formatted PDF
   ```
3. Add basic PDF handling and formatting
4. Set up automatic API documentation

## Deployment Ready (15 minutes)
1. Create render.yaml
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure for production

## Quick Testing (10 minutes)
1. Test local setup
2. Verify PDF generation
3. Check API documentation

## Tips for Success
- Keep the SQLite database simple - one table for resumes
- Use FastAPI's built-in features for validation and docs
- Focus on core functionality first
- Use reportlab for simple PDF generation
- Leverage FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI docs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overcomplicating the database schema
- Spending too much time on PDF formatting
- Not using FastAPI's built-in features
- Forgetting to set up CORS
- Not testing the production setup

## One-Shot Checklist
- [ ] Basic FastAPI app running
- [ ] SQLite database connected
- [ ] PDF upload working
- [ ] PDF generation working
- [ ] API docs accessible
- [ ] Render configuration ready
- [ ] Environment variables set
